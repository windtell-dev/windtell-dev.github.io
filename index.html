      <p>
        I watched the CRA UR2PhD Spring workshop series webinar, workshop #4, 
        <em>“How Computing Can Fit My Other Interests”</em> uploaded on Monday, May 7, 2024. 
        I liked how seamlessly the speakers wove computing into fields as diverse as indoor robotic agriculture, retro gaming hardware, AI-driven art, paleontology, and behavioral economics, and by the energy they brought as technical founders. 
        Their stories showed me that no matter how niche my passion may seem, whether it’s positive-psychology frameworks or community-driven mental-health interventions, there’s a place for it in computing research. 
        As a result, I’m committing this summer to explore new interdisciplinary collaborations (for instance, with psychology and education colleagues), to prototype generative-AI and RAG features in my Discord chatbot project, and to integrate data-driven personalization methods that tailor mental-health strategies for underrepresented CS students.

    <!-- Week 5 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Week 5 (6/30 - 7/04)</h2>

      </ul>
      <h3>Reflection:</h3>
      <p>
        I think the perception of myself that my teammates have of me align with the work I have contributed. 
        Our team has been very consistent, so I would say our team has only improved since the mid-course research reflection, 
        from the growing skills me and teammate Anthony have gained in this class.
